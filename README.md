## Assumptions & Limitations
- The project assumes the user has a stable internet connection to fetch movie data from the TMDB API
- Only the English language movies are displayed; multi-language support is not implemented.
- Movie data depends entirely on the TMDB API; if the API is down or rate-limited, some features may not work.
- Favorites are stored locally in the browser (e.g., localStorage); there is no backend persistence.
- Dark/Light mode preferences are stored locally and will not sync across devices.
Some edge cases like duplicate movie IDs may not be handled in the UI.
